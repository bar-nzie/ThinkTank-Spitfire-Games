Welcome to the skies pilot! You're sittin' in a legend - the Supermarine Spitfire. She's not just a plane, she's a sybol of defience, grit and British engineering at its finest!

Look at those wings - eliptical and sleek. Not just for show, lad! Designed by R.J. Mitchell to cut through the air like a razor. That shape gives you tighter turns and faster rolls.

First took to the air back in 1936. By the time the war came knockin', the Spitfire was ready. She earned her stripes in the Battle of Britain - held the line when the world damn near fell apart.

That hum you hear? That's the nRolls-Royce Merlin engine singin'. Pure power. Some later models even ran on the Griffon engine - turned this bird into a beast!
